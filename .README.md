Hi Gang!  

The name of this project is Restaurant Home Page.

what we are doing is each contributing to building out the layout of the page.   

It doe not need navigation or even need to be responsive.

The whole point is to practice sending each other pull request, leaving comments or instructions in Github, branches, etc.

At some point, we will meet in chat on Discord to touch bases and see where we are all at.

This should be fun and will give us experience working in groups!

Feel free to add to the README notes!

Happy coding!   :)
